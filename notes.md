there is progress to be made and implementing semantic prompt viewing in the inspector would be useful.

maybe we need to memorize the cursor offset and restore it after clearing the prev prompt, so we would never be starting at column 0.

we should put more of the repo into text files (maybe just one per zig file or one per directory) and get nebula to explain the general flow and roles. Then how we should add visualization for semantic prompt marks. If we could visualize it like #5932 above, we would have a much easier time of things.
